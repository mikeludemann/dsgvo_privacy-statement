    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically

    <h3>SSL or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and for the protection of the transmission of confidential
        content, such as the inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection in
        your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's

    <p>Payment transactions using common means of payment (Visa/MasterCard, direct debit) are only made via encrypted SSL or

    <h2>4. Data collection on our website</h2>
    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses. Cookies help make
        our website more user-friendly, efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer
        and saved by your browser.</p>
    <p>Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies
        remain in your device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to recognize your browser when
        you next visit the site.</p>
    <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
        whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
        under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
        Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
    <p>Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such
        as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate
        interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies
        (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy
        policy.</p>
    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p>The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in
        "server log files". These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Host name of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p>
    <p>The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for
        measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
    <h3>Contact form</h3>
    <p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact
        details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without
        your permission.</p>
    <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO.
        You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed
        before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage,
        or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions,
        especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>
    <h3>Registration on this website</h3>
    <p>You can register on our website in order to access additional functions offered here. The input data will only be used
        for the purpose of using the respective site or service for which you have registered. The mandatory information
        requested during registration must be provided in full. Otherwise, we will reject your registration.</p>
    <p>To inform you about important changes such as those within the scope of our site or technical changes, we will use the
        email address specified during registration.</p>
    <p>We will process the data provided during registration only based on your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke
        your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed
        before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>We will continue to store the data collected during registration for as long as you remain registered on our website.
        Statutory retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
    <h3>Registration with Facebook Connect</h3>
    <p>Instead of registering directly on our website, you may also register using Facebook Connect. This service is provided
        by Facebook Ireland Limited, 4 Grand Canal Square, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
    <p>If you decide to register with Facebook Connect and click on the "Login with Facebook" or "Connect with Facebook" buttons,
        you will be automatically redirected to the Facebook platform. There you can log in with your Facebook username and
        password. This will link your Facebook profile to our website or services. This link gives us access to your data

    <p>
        <strong>How long comments are stored</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the content commented
        upon has been completely deleted or the comments are required to be removed for legal reasons (slander, etc.).</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Legal basis</strong>
    </p>
    <p>The comments are stored based on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time with
        future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request
        may still be legally processed.</p>
    <h3>Processing of data (customer and contract data)</h3>

        a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract. We collect, process and use your personal data when accessing
        our website (usage data) only to the extent required to enable you to access our service or to bill you for the same.</p>
    <p>Collected customer data shall be deleted after completion of the order or termination of the business relationship. Legal
        retention periods remain unaffected.</p>
    <h3>Data transmitted when entering into a contract with online shops, retailers, and mail order</h3>

        click on one of these buttons.</p>
    <p>This tool does not automatically transfer user data to the operators of these platforms. If users are logged into one
        or more of the social networks, the Like, +1, and Share buttons for Facebook, Google+1, Twitter, etc. will display
        an information window in which the user can edit the text before it is sent.</p>
    <p>Our users can share the content of this page on social networks without their providers creating profiles of users' surfing
        behavior.</p>
    <h3>Facebook plugins (Like & Share buttons)</h3>
    <p>Our website includes plugins for the social network Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025,

        <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/" target="_blank">https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.</p>
    <p>When you visit our site, a direct connection between your browser and the Facebook server is established via the plugin.
        This enables Facebook to receive information that you have visited our site from your IP address. If you click on
        the Facebook "Like button" while you are logged into your Facebook account, you can link the content of our site
        to your Facebook profile. This allows Facebook to associate visits to our site with your user account. Please note
        that, as the operator of this site, we have no knowledge of the content of the data transmitted to Facebook or of
        how Facebook uses these data. For more information, please see Facebook's privacy policy at

        also be transferred to Twitter. We would like to point out that, as the provider of these pages, we have no knowledge
        of the content of the data transmitted or how it will be used by Twitter. For more information on Twitter's privacy

    <p>Our pages use Google+ functions. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
    <p>Collection and disclosure of information: Using the Google +1 button allows you to publish information worldwide. By
        means of the Google+ button, you and other users can receive custom content from Google and our partners. Google
        stores both the fact that you have +1'd a piece of content and information about the page you were viewing when you
        clicked +1. Your +1 can be displayed together with your profile name and photo in Google services, for example in
        search results or in your Google profile, or in other places on websites and advertisements on the Internet.</p>
    <p>Google records information about your +1 activities to improve Google services for you and others. To use the Google
        + button, you need a globally visible, public Google profile that must contain at least the name chosen for the profile.
        This name is used by all Google services. In some cases, this name may also replace a different name that you have
        used to share content via your Google account. The identity of your Google profile can be shown to users who know
        your email address or other information that can identify you.</p>
    <p>Use of collected data: In addition to the uses mentioned above, the information you provide is used in accordance with
        the applicable Google data protection policies. Google may publish summary statistics about users' +1 activity or
        share it with users and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or affiliate websites.</p>

    <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
    <p>This website uses Google AdSense, a service for including advertisements from Google Inc. ("Google"). It is operated
        by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
    <p>Google AdSense uses so-called "cookies", which are text files stored in your computer that enable an analysis of the
        way you use the website. Google AdSense also uses so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Through these web beacons,
        information such as the visitor traffic on these pages can be evaluated.</p>
    <p>The information generated by cookies and web beacons relating to your use of this website (including your IP address),
        and delivery of advertising formats, is transmitted to a Google server in the US and stored there. This information
        can be passed on from Google to contracting parties of Google. However, Google will not merge your IP address with

    <h3>Google Analytics Remarketing</h3>
    <p>Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords
        and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
    <p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing
        to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed
        based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g.
        your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>
    <p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for
        this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional
        messaging.</p>
    <p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our
        Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
    <p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google
        Account; follow this link:
        <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
    <p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give
        or withdraw from Google per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account
        (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is
        based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior
        for promotional purposes.</p>

    <h3>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h3>
    <p>This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway,
        Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
    <p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion
        tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies
        expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages
        of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad
        and proceeded to that page.</p>
    <p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords
        advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the
        AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked
        on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information
        that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of
        this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you
        will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
    <p>Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing
        user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
    <p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy:
        <a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/"

    <p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis
        whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies
        under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser.
        Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
    <h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
    <p>We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater
        Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
    <p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a
        human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various
        characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis,
        reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse
        movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p>
    <p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis
        is taking place.</p>
    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site
        from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>

    <h3>Facebook Pixel</h3>
    <p>Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook, Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
        Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook").</p>
    <p>These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website.
        This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes
        and their future optimization. </p>
    <p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about
        our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your
        Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/"
            target="_blank">Facebook privacy policy</a>. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We
        have no control over how this data is used.</p>

    <h2>7. Newsletter</h2>
    <h3>Newsletter data</h3>
    <p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to
        verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional
        data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information
        and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
    <p>We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO.
        You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter
        at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request
        may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
        subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the
        members area) remain unaffected.</p>
    <h3>MailChimp</h3>
    <p>This website uses the services of MailChimp to send newsletters. This service is provided by Rocket Science Group LLC,

    <p>MailChimp is a service which organizes and analyzes the distribution of newsletters. If you provide data (e.g. your email
        address) to subscribe to our newsletter, it will be stored on MailChimp servers in the USA.</p>
    <p>MailChimp is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is an agreement between the European Union
        (EU) and the US to ensure compliance with European privacy standards in the United States.</p>
    <p>We use MailChimp to analyze our newsletter campaigns. When you open an email sent by MailChimp, a file included in the
        email (called a web beacon) connects to MailChimp's servers in the United States. This allows us to determine if
        a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. In addition, technical information is collected
        (e.g. time of retrieval, IP address, browser type, and operating system). This information cannot be assigned to
        a specific recipient. It is used exclusively for the statistical analysis of our newsletter campaigns. The results
        of these analyses can be used to better tailor future newsletters to your interests.</p>
    <p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by MailChimp, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter.
        For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly
        on the website.</p>
    <p>Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at any time by unsubscribing to the newsletter.
        The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
    <p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your
        subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers and those of MailChimp. Data we have stored for other
        purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
